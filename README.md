Spiderman, spiderman does whatever a spider can!

I watched Spiderverse a few days ago, and now im suddenly obsessed. Full on.

I really like Spidernoir if you couldnt tell by my Discord and Github.

Ive actually watched it a couple times, But that was like... 5 years ago?

Happy new years by the way!
